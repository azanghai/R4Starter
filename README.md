Welcome! 

Welcome to the Beginners' Tutorial for R Language. This tutorial is based on the Advanced Data Skills, Open Science and Reproducibility course taught by Professor Andrew Stewart at the University of Manchester (with granted permission), and has been modified and supplemented for this presentation. Details of these modifications and additions can be found in the "References" section at the end of each chapter. Also, the original course materials (in English) by Professor Andrew Stewart are available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ajstewartlang/MRes_BIOL63101).

During my studies under Professor Andrew Stewart, I was inspired by his selfless commitment to open-source principles and his impressive academic abilities, which led me to the idea of translating his open-source course. Thus, this course was created. Here, I would also like to pay tribute to all designers and creators of open-source software and tutorials.

Through this series of lessons, I hope that you will master the basic syntax of the R language, be able to write R code and create R Markdown documents for data preprocessing, analysis, presentation, and reporting, as well as gain a fundamental understanding of statistical analysis methods.
